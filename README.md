# Gephi Toolkit Demos

The Gephi Toolkit project package essential modules (Graph, Layout, Filters, IO...) in a standard Java library, which any Java project can use for getting things done.

The toolkit is just a single JAR that anyone could reuse in a Java program. This tutorial aims to introduce the project, show possibilities and start write some code.

## Use this demos:

- Open the project in Netbeans IDE.
- Each demo is independent from each other.
- Run demos by calling script() method or via maven `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.gephi.toolkit.demos.Main"`.
- Change the main class to execute a demo
